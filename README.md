# Thought Process
- First I know that I could have used some library and reduced this project to half of the code that I have done but, I wanted to learn data strucutre and algorithm at the time I made this project 
- So, HTML 5 has this amazing thing called Canvas ( I used it for drawing my snake board )
- Drawing the game to the canvas every iteration according to the coorinates of snake and food

### Movements
- A simple variable ( direction )
- Incrementing or Decrementing coordinates according to the direction
